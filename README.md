## Project Description and Objectives 
Air pollution in the form of fine particulate matter, PM2.5, is contributing to respiratory related illnesses and deaths. The purpose of this study is to address this growing public health concern in the Shunyi District of Beijing, China by examining four predictive models. For this study, it was hypothesized that the top five predictors would be the actual pollutants found in the
atmosphere: PM10, SO2, NO2 , CO, and O3. To carry out this hypothesis the following models were examined: ordinary least square regression (OLS) model, partial least squares (PLS) model, Random Forest model, and Elastic Net model. Subsequently it was hypothesized that the best model will be the Elastic Net model with an R2 value of 0.8. The data was preprocessed too correct for multicollinearity, near zero variance predictors, skewness, and outliers. The Elastic Net model was found to be the best model with the top five predictors as PM10, CO, NO2, SO2,and WSPM.
## Machine Learning Goals 
* Create machine learning algorithms that can accurately predict PM2.5 levels
## Business Goals 
* Â Help with on going efforts to reduce air pollution in the form of fine particulate matter 
* Employ predictive model within 7 weeks from start date (May 7th, 2022 - June 25th, 2022)
